# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2026-06-26

The following is a bunch of placeholder text on how _Astro_ works as a platform for **blogging**. By the way, I used a slash at the end of this page to see if it breaks into a new paragraph appropriately.\
The nice thing is that I already write in Markdown quite frequently so I can be very fast when I do this type of thing. This page instead uses two spaces at the end for an "invisible" page break.  

And this line is broken out with a blank line in between as you would do on a standard word processor.

`Placeholder Text Follows`

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
